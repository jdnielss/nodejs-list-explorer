1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script and the Spring Boot project.
4. Run the following command:
    \`\`\`
    node index.js ${projectPath}
